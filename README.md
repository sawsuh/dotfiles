So: How to install these dots?
well, just run 'stow -R -t ~ -d $currentpath $computer' where $currentpath is the path of this folder and $computer is desktop or thinkpad. before doing so, though, you might want to make sure that the mozilla folder structure, the oh my zsh folder structure, the local/bin folder structure, and the config/systemd folder structure all exist - to make sure that we arent producing files in random folders.
